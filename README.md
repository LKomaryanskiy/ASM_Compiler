# ASM_Compiler
This is my course work, which i did in second course of my graduation.
Actually, at now i think it's a terrible code, cause it has methods with 400+ rows, terrible code organization, but it was a great lesson for me and i understand many things about ASM, how to work compiler and etc. At now, i think, i make this work quite differently.
I hope you understand me =)

Ok, description this work:
This project consists with 4 parts:
1. Lexical analyser, which parse the asm file and build tables with lexems.
2. Grammatical analyser, which create table, where placed information about every row.
3. First pass - create file, with commands offsets. 
4. Second pass - create opcodes for every command.

And i had implemented the part of ASMx86 commands and functions, which i had in my variant.
